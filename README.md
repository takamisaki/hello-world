# hello-world
this is a place where I start to learn to be a iOS developer, started at 6 Apr. 2016, when I am already 30.
and more information about me, I love computer so much but I chose BA because of the Chinese education policy, and I had acted as a headhunter for 7 years before I made decision to change career to be an iOS developer. 
I have no backup, I know I like it, so I am gonna make it happen on me :P
